# Test Summary for Expense Tracker

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing infrastructure set up for the Expense Tracker application. The tests are designed to ensure that our application, particularly the AI-powered features for receipt and odometer reading extraction, function correctly and handle errors gracefully.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized as follows:

### Unit Tests
- `/test/utils/ai-processing.test.ts`: Tests for the AI processing utility that handles receipt and odometer image extraction
- `/test/utils/retry-mechanism.test.ts`: Tests for the retry mechanism used in the AI processing utility

### Component Tests
- `/test/components/MileageForm.test.ts`: Tests for the mileage form component
- `/test/components/ExpenseForm.test.ts`: Tests for the expense form component

### Integration Tests
- `/test/integration/mileage-ai-integration.test.ts`: Integration tests for the AI extraction functionality with the mileage form

## Test Configuration

- Vitest is used as the test runner
- JSDOM is used for the browser environment simulation
- Mocks are used for Nuxt's runtime config, stores, and browser APIs
- Tests are set up to run in parallel for better performance

## Running Tests

The following npm scripts are available for running tests:

```
npm test            # Run all tests
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

## Test Coverage

Key areas covered by the tests include:

1. **AI Processing Utility**
   - Successful extraction of receipt data
   - Successful extraction of odometer readings
   - Error handling for network issues
   - Error handling for API rate limiting
   - Error handling for service unavailability
   - Validation of extracted data
   - Error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)

2. **Form Components**
   - Form rendering
   - Form validation
   - Form submission
   - AI extraction integration
   - Error handling and display
   - Application of extracted data to form fields

3. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Retry on retryable errors
   - No retry on non-retryable errors
   - Respecting maximum retry count
   - Exponential backoff delay between retries

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Detailed error types with error codes
   - Error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
   - User-friendly error messages based on error type

2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Automatic retry for transient errors
   - Configurable retry count and delay
   - Exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming services

3. **Robust Data Validation**
   - Confidence score validation
   - Type checking and conversion
   - Fallback to default values when needed

## Future Test Enhancements

1. **Store Tests**
   - Add tests for Pinia stores
   - Test state management and API interactions

2. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Add Cypress or Playwright tests for full user workflows
   - Test UI interactions and state persistence

3. **API Mocking**
   - Enhance mocking of Supabase API interactions
   - Test database operations

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test application performance under load
   - Measure and optimize resource usage

5. **Snapshot Testing**
   - Add snapshot tests for UI components
   - Ensure UI consistency across changes
