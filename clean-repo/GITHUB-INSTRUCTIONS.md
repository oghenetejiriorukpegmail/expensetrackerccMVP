# GitHub Repository Instructions

This is a clean copy of the Expense Tracker application created for uploading to GitHub without any token issues. GitHub's token scanning is detecting tokens in the commit history of the original repository, which is preventing the push.

## How to Upload This Repository to GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "expensetrackerccMVP" at https://github.com/new

2. Initialize the clean repository and push it:
   ```bash
   cd /home/admin/expensetrackercc/clean-repo
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Expense Tracker application"
   
   # Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual GitHub token:
   GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN" bash -c '
     git remote add origin https://oghenetejiriorukpegmail:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/oghenetejiriorukpegmail/expensetrackerccMVP.git
     git push -f origin main
   '
   ```

## About This Repository

This is a clean version of the Expense Tracker application with the core files needed for the application to function. It includes:

- Vue.js components and pages
- Nuxt.js configuration
- Store files for state management
- Server code for API endpoints
- Utility functions
- Configuration files

## Additional Modifications Made

1. Removed all potential GitHub tokens from configuration files
2. Excluded node_modules and build directories
3. Created a fresh repository without token history

## Note About GitHub Token Scanning

GitHub's token scanning is very thorough and will detect tokens in the commit history, not just in the current files. This is why a completely new repository is needed rather than trying to modify the existing one.
