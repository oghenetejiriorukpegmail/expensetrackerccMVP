# GitHub Repository Upload Instructions

Due to GitHub's security measures that prevent pushing repository tokens, I've prepared a clean branch without any tokens. Here's how to push the repository to GitHub:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token (with security precautions)

1. Update the token in the push script immediately before running it (don't commit it):
   ```bash
   cd /home/admin/expensetrackercc
   
   # Switch to the clean branch
   git checkout clean-branch
   
   # Replace TOKEN with your actual token in the command below
   GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" bash -c '
     git remote remove origin
     git remote add origin https://oghenetejiriorukpegmail:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/oghenetejiriorukpegmail/expensetrackerccMVP.git
     git push -f origin clean-branch:main
   '
   ```

This approach avoids storing the token in a file and will push the clean branch as the main branch.

## Option 2: Create a New Clean Repository

If you want to start completely fresh without any chance of token issues:

1. Create a new local repository:
   ```bash
   cd /home/admin
   mkdir clean-expense-tracker
   cd clean-expense-tracker
   git init
   ```

2. Copy files from the existing repository (excluding .git and node_modules):
   ```bash
   cd /home/admin/clean-expense-tracker
   cp -r /home/admin/expensetrackercc/* .
   rm -rf node_modules .git .nuxt .output
   ```

3. Create a .gitignore file:
   ```bash
   echo "node_modules/
   .nuxt/
   .output/
   .env" > .gitignore
   ```

4. Initialize and commit:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of expense tracker application"
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # Replace TOKEN with your actual token
   GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" bash -c '
     git remote add origin https://oghenetejiriorukpegmail:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/oghenetejiriorukpegmail/expensetrackerccMVP.git
     git push -f origin main
   '
   ```

## Option 3: Use GitHub Web Interface

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called "expensetrackerccMVP"
2. Upload files through the web interface
3. You may need to upload in batches due to file size limitations

## Next Steps After Successful Upload

Once the code is pushed to GitHub, you can:

1. Clone the repository to work with it locally
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
3. Configure branch protection rules to prevent accidental sensitive information exposure in the future
